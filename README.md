# Engineering Gotchas: What You Didn‚Äôt Think To Ask

Welcome to the **Engineering Gotchas** series, where I look into often-overlooked challenges in system design, distributed processing, and more. Each episode will focus on a particular scenario, with a code implementation in Go (Golang), along with explanations and gotchas that may not be immediately obvious.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find solutions to real-world engineering challenges that come up frequently but are often overlooked. Each episode covers a scenario with a common solution and highlights a "gotcha" that you may not have considered. All solutions are written in **Golang**, and while simplified for clarity, they are practical enough to be applied in real-world applications.

Feel free to clone the repository and explore the code. Solutions include detailed comments to make understanding the implementation easier.

## Episodes

### Episode 1: Ensuring Fairness in Asynchronous Processing

**Scenario**:  
You‚Äôre building a system to process large transaction records for multiple clients, each submitting up to 1 million records at any given time. The system needs to handle these transactions efficiently, ensuring each client‚Äôs submission is processed in a fair and orderly manner, even with multiple clients submitting at the same time.

An initial approach might involve using an **asynchronous process** where a background worker processes transactions one by one, with retry logic in case of failure. However, there‚Äôs a challenge:

‚ùì **How do you ensure that the client who submits their records first is processed first?**  
With an asynchronous approach, there's no inherent guarantee that requests will be processed in the order they're received, especially when multiple workers are processing transactions concurrently.

**Trick**:  
To address this, This episode involves the design of a system where transaction batches are submitted to a queue and processed in the order they arrive. Each client is assigned a lock (mutex) to ensure only one worker processes their transactions at a time, maintaining consistency and preventing overlap.

**The solution includes**:
- Transaction queues to handle batch submissions in order.
- Client-specific locking to ensure that only one worker processes a client‚Äôs transactions at a time.
- Retry logic to gracefully handle failures.

üîë **Follow-up**: What happens when multiple clients are submitting large files simultaneously? How do you ensure no client is unfairly delayed or prioritized, and how do you balance the load across workers?

## How to Navigate the Series

Each episode is self-contained and focuses on solving a specific problem. The episodes are structured as follows:

1. **Scenario**: A real-world engineering problem you're likely to encounter.
2. **Gotcha**: The overlooked challenge that can arise when solving this problem.
3. **Solution**: The approach I‚Äôve taken to solve the problem using Golang. This includes simplified code where appropriate and detailed comments in the codebase.
4. **Follow-up**: Additional considerations or edge cases that could be explored further.
